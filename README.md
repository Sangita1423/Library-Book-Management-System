Python Library Management System is important software which is used in the libraries of schools and colleges for adding new books in the library, issuing books to students and maintaining the record of the book that is returned. 

## About  

All the functions in the library are managed by the library management system. A personâ€™s activities in the library can be automated with the help of this system. We will create a library management system that will handle various activities in a library.

## Outcome of the Project

In this project, I will developed a library management system that will help us in performing various functions like display books ,search a book, adding a book, issuing a book, delete a book and exit. It will also store the issue of the book. Furthermore, the data of books that are stored can be edited and deleted.
